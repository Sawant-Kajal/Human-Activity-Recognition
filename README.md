# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model for **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using sensor data. The goal is to classify different human activities (such as walking, sitting, standing, etc.) based on time-series features collected from smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.

## 📂 Project Structure
- HAR.ipynb – Main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow  
- dataset/ – Dataset files (if applicable)  
- README.md – Project documentation  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data loading and preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Building and training multiple ML models for classification  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics  
- Final model selection for best performance  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for implementation and visualization  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.  

---

## 📊 Results
- Achieved **high classification accuracy** on test data  
- Visualized activity patterns for better understanding of sensor signals
